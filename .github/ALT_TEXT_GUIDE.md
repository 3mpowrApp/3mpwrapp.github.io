# Alt Text Guide

Good alt text focuses on the image’s purpose.

- Informational: describe the essential info the image conveys
- Functional: describe the action the image performs (e.g., “Search” for a search icon button)
- Decorative: use empty alt (`alt=""`) so screen readers skip it

Tips:
- Be concise and specific—aim for under 125 characters when possible
- Don’t include “image of” or “picture of”
- If the text in the image is important, put that text in the page content or the alt
- Complex charts: provide a nearby caption/summary or a linked long description
